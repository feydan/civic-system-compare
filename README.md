## Data entry

At first, we will have civic workers input data about their systems via a form.  The system will expose this information for comparison.

Data entry would require login and an email address from the city:


### Sources of information
- Senate Bill 272 requires cities provide information about the enterprise systems that are used.  This could be used to input data into the system.  Simple Google searches can be used to find this information.
